#  6 DoF estimation network

## Based on Mask-RCNN

I am afraid that the current repo doesn't generate the winning solution of the ApolloScape 3D car Instance Understanding challenge.
However, a very under-documented repo does have the winning solution code:
https://github.com/stevenwudi/ApolloScape_InstanceSeg

Hope it helps

## Dataset:

- [Pascal3D+](http://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/pascal3d.html)
- [ApolloScape 3D Car Instance](http://apolloscape.auto/car_instance.html)
- [Kitti](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/)
